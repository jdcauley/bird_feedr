## Bird Feeder

A little project to consolidate my RSS feeds and use Twitter as my RSS reader.

I created a new Twitter account that publishes the aggregated feed to Twitter so I can add articles to Instapaper quickly and easily in Tweetbot.

It's stupid simple to install, clone the repo and add your feeds in the top of the index.php file and you're golden.

Plans for future:
	Move to RSS parse/compile to Node.js
	Publish to Twitter with custom solution
